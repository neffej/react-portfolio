## Description
Ultimately, we do not toil in the dark. At least that's the hope. This website is a showcase of myself and my work and serves as a hub to share my progress and my goals to others. I will send this link out to employers and potential clients so that they can review my work and skills, and so that they can contact me easily should they want to.
